# EditCorner

**EditCorner** is a fork of the **CustomCorner** extension that allows you to configure hot corners, with improvements for the new versions of GNOME Shell.

All credits to **Everett Cheng** who developed the [**CustomCorner**](https://gitlab.com/eccheng/customcorner) extension, on which EditCorner is based.
